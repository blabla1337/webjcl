 # JESWorker
 
 This contains the original code that was used to submit jobs to the mainframe. Despite it's spaghetti code: it's still here because it has worked for students fairly reliably for over a year.
 
 It would be nice to refactor it into a better design-- possibly even interfacing with ftp directly from node instead of forking python processes.
